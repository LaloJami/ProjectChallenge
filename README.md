# Objective
Complete a small project to show my skills, knowledge, problem solving.

# Project Details
The application was developed in React Native and Expo CLI. The main specifications are to establish a listing page where you can see the site’s name, address, and image. The second page shows the site’s details with the contact information.

# Observations
* The app was developed in Windows OS, so the Android version was tested however the iOS version needs to be tested and improved.
* I configure an .env to keep the api address, you need to create your .env file and write:
```
API_SITES=https://the/api/path/example
```
